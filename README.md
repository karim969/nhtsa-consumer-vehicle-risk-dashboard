# Consumer Vehicle Risk Dashboard – NHTSA (Tableau)

## Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Tableau dashboard built using National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) vehicle complaint data to help identify high-risk vehicle models and components based on complaint severity.

## Business Problem
Vehicle safety analysis often relies on raw complaint counts, which can understate serious but less frequent safety issues. Stakeholders need a clearer way to identify which vehicles and components present the greatest safety risk.

## Objective
Create an interactive dashboard that highlights vehicle safety risk using severity-weighted metrics, enabling users to explore risk by manufacturer, model, model year, and component.

## Data
- Source: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
- Records: 1M+ consumer vehicle complaints
- Key fields: Manufacturer, Model, Model Year, Component, Injuries, Deaths, Crashes, Fires

## Dashboard Features
- Severity-weighted risk scoring to emphasize high-impact incidents
- Interactive filtering by manufacturer, model, and component
- Drill-down views for component-level root cause analysis
- Dynamic tooltips highlighting key risk drivers

## Key Insights
- Engine, electrical system, and airbag failures consistently rank highest in safety risk
- Certain vehicle models show elevated risk across multiple components
- Severity-based analysis provides clearer risk signals than complaint volume alone

## Tools Used
- Tableau (calculated fields, parameters, dashboards)

## Outcome
Delivered an interactive, decision-ready dashboard that supports data-driven vehicle safety assessment and consumer risk awareness.
